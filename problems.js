// The following is a list of 20 problems that are intended to be solved using JavaScript.
// Each problem includes a description of the problem and a list of things to consider. If you don't have data to use make some up. Be creative and play with the problems. The more you play with them the better you will get at solving them.


// Problem 1: Sum of Numbers
// Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).
// Use the formula: sum = n * (n + 1) / 2

// Problem 2: List of Even Numbers
// Create an array containing all even numbers from 2 up to a given number n.

// Problem 3: Character Count in a String
// Count the number of times a specific character appears in a given string.

// Problem 4: List of Prime Numbers
// Generate an array of all prime numbers up to a given number n.

// Problem 5: Reverse a String
// Take a string and reverse its characters using a loop.

// Problem 6: Fibonacci Sequence
// Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.
// Each number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding ones.

// Problem 7: Find the Maximum Number in an Array
// Iterate through an array to find and return the maximum value.

// Problem 8: Nested Loop - Multiplication Table
// Use nested loops to create a multiplication table up to a given number.

// Problem 9: Check for Palindrome
// Determine if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

// Problem 10: Factorial of a Number
// Calculate the factorial of a given number n.
// The factorial of n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

// Problem 11: Sum of Digits
// Given a number, find the sum of its digits.

// Problem 12: List Multiples of a Number
// Create an array listing the first n multiples of a given number.

// Problem 13: Count Down Timer
// Create a countdown that logs numbers from a given number n down to 0.

// Problem 14: Array Element Count
// Count the number of times a specific element appears in an array.

// Problem 15: Sorting an Array
// Implement a basic sorting algorithm (like Bubble Sort) to sort an array of numbers.

// Problem 16: Finding Duplicates in an Array
// Identify duplicate values in a given array and list them.

// Problem 17: Character Frequency in a String
// Calculate and log the frequency of each character in a given string.

// Problem 18: Intersection of Two Arrays
// Find and return the common elements (intersection) of two arrays.

// Problem 19: Matrix Diagonal Sum
// Calculate the sum of the diagonals in a 2D matrix. A 2D matrix is represented as an array of arrays. For example: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]].

// Problem 20: Array Flattening
// Flatten a nested array (an array of arrays) into a single-level array.
